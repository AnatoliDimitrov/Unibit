If! you wonder what Lincoln said about slavery, you will find the richest source of quotations in his political writings from 1854 to 1865. In 1854, Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas pushed the Kansas-Nebraska Act through Congress, which in effect repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and opened new territories to slavery. This egregious maneuver motivated Lincoln to act; when he reflected on it six years later he wrote, "In 1854 his profession had almost superseded the thought of politics in his mind, when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused him as he had never been before."
Anyone who reads Lincoln's writings of this period can see that he came out swinging against slavery: he was intense, focused, even furious at times. But this response did not arise ex nihilo; rather it rested on a long-standing antipathy toward slavery. In 1837, as a 28-year-old member of the Illinois General Assembly, he and a fellow legislator made an unpopular public protest about slavery, denouncing it as being "founded on both injustice and bad policy." As late as 1864 he wrote, "I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did no so think, and feel."
